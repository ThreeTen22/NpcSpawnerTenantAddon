  "description" : "N.P.C. Inc. Is proud to present its first major Addon to its family of npc mangament and modification tools! \nIntroducing:\nThe Tenantator 2000.\n\nWith this tool you will be able to unlock many of the hidden vanilla cababilities that colony deeds have to offer including multiple tenants per deed, monster tenants, and the ability to create valid houses without the need for background tiles.\n\nIn addition, you will be able to manage the tenants themselves.  As of now, you will be able to prevent crewmember graduation, (now you can do all the quests you want!) and prevent quest participation alltogether.  (now everyone wont have exclamation marks over their head).\n\nThese options are on a tenant-by-tenant basis, so feel free to customize each one as you see fit.\n\nYou will also be able to export these NPC tenants as NPC Cards (vanilla items that are modified to contain npc data). These cards are used for backup, management, and are designed to work with NpcSpawner+ 3100 series spawner objects!  So feel free to export a tenant, modify it using a NpcSpawner+ object, and re-import the changed tenant!\n\nHow To Make:\n[olist]\n[*]Create a T3 Table\n[*]Create an Employer Station\n[*]Purchase the Tenantator 2000\n[/olist]\n\nHow to Use:\n[olist]\n[*]Find the deed you wish to modify\n[*]With the tenantator out, mouseover the deed and press the LMB\n[*]Modify the deed via the bottom menu, and/or by selecting a tenant or \"new tenant\" list option\n[/olist]\n\n\nMultiplayer/Vanilla-compatible Information:\n\nFull Multiplayer Compatibility:\n[list]\n[*]All deed modifications\n[*]All tenant modifications\n[*]Multi tenant support\n[*]Having the Tenantator in your inventory (although its best practice to keep it in your shiplocker if you dont know whether the server has this mod installed)\n[/list]\n\nSituation-based multiplayer compatbility:\n\nFull Compatibility - Both you and the server have this mod installed.\nYou are set.  Just be wary about other players that are around you (on the same planet/ship as you).  If they do not have the mod and you use the tool, you will kick them off the server.\n\nPartial Compatibility:  The server has this mod, you do not.\nIf the server has this mod and you do not, then you will be disconnected if you are on the same planet/ship as another player that tries to use the tenantator.  Any deeds that have been modified by this tool by other players will not affect your connectivity as the modifications done are in the base game.\n\nPartial Compatibility:  You have this mod, the server does not.\nThe tools will act like any other active item that isnt installed on the server.  It will be in your inventory, but will crash you out of the server if you try and use it.  Any deed you modified on your ship (and therefore will transfer to a multiplayer server) will still function with your modified settings.\n\n\nHave fun!",
