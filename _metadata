  "description" : "[h1]N.P.C. Inc.[/h1] Is proud to present its first major Addon to its family of npc mangament and modification tools! \nIntroducing:\n[h1]The Tenantator:  2000 ed.[/h1]\n\nWith this tool you will be able to unlock many of the hidden vanilla cababilities that colony deeds have to offer including multiple tenants per deed, monster tenants, and the ability to create valid houses without the need for background tiles.\n\nIn addition, you will be able to manage the tenants themselves.  As of now, you will be able to prevent crewmember graduation, (now you can do all the quests you want!) and prevent quest participation alltogether.  (now everyone wont have exclamation marks over their head).  These options are on a tenant-by-tenant basis, so feel free to customize each one as you see fit.\n\nYou will also be able to export these NPC tenants as NPC Cards (vanilla items that are modified to contain npc data). These cards are used for backup, management, and are designed to work with NpcSpawner+ 3100 series spawner objects!  So feel free to export a tenant, modify it using a NpcSpawner+ object, and re-import the changed tenant!\n\n[h1]How To Make:[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]Create a T3 Table\n[*]Create an Employer Station\n[*]Purchase the Tenantator 2000\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]How to Use:[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]Find the deed you wish to modify\n[*]With the tenantator out, mouseover the deed and press the LMB\n[*]Modify the deed via the bottom menu, and/or by selecting a tenant or \"new tenant\" list option\n[/olist]\n\n\n[h1]Full Multiplayer Compatibility:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]All deed modifications\n[*]All tenant modifications\n[*]Multi tenant support\n[*]NPC Cards\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Situation-based multiplayer compatbility:[/h1]\n\n[h1]Full Compatibility: Both you and the server have this mod installed.[/h1]\nYou are set.  Just be wary about other players that are around you (on the same planet/ship as you).  If they do not have the mod and you use the tool, you will kick them off the server.\n\n[h1]Partial Compatibility:  The server has this mod, you do not.[/h1]\nIf the server has this mod and you do not, then you will be disconnected if you are on the same planet/ship as another player that tries to use the tenantator.  Any deeds that have been modified by this tool by other players will not affect your connectivity as the modifications done are in the base game.\n\n[h1]Partial Compatibility:  You have this mod, the server does not.[/h1]\nThe tool will act like any other custom active item that isnt installed on the server.  It will be in your inventory, but will crash you out of the server if you try and use it.  Any deed you modified on your ship (and therefore will transfer to a multiplayer server) will still function with your modified settings.\n\n\n[h1]Security:[/h1]This tool's functionality is limited to Deeds that only beling to you!  This is to prevent griefing.  Hope you understand!\n\n\n[h1]Uninstallation:[/h1]\nWhile a simple unsubscribe will do the trick, its best practice to delete the item before doing so. The employer's table that this item is bought from is an unused vanilla asset, and will not cause asset mismatching errors.\n\n[b]Technical details:[/b]\nThe mod comes with a custom activeitem \"npcinjector\" and stagehand \"colonymanager\".  On use, the activeitem creates the stagehand that acts on behalf of the deed you are modifiing.  This includes modifying tenant information and deed config parameters.  Once the player is too far away, or closes the pane menu, the stagehand is destroyed.  The stagehand extremely lightweight, self-cleaning and non-persistant so nothing remains after modification is complete, which will allow for easy installation/uninstallation and will allow for MP sessions without breaking the deeds themselves nor locking out the player.\nHave fun!",
