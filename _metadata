  "description" : "[h1]N.P.C. Inc.[/h1] Is proud to present its first major Add-on to its family of npc creation, mangament and modification tools! Introducing:\n[h1]The Tenantator[/h1]\n[i]2000 series[/i]\n\n\nWith this tool you will be able to unlock many of the hidden vanilla cababilities that colony deeds have to offer including multiple tenants per deed, monster tenants, and the ability to create valid houses without the need for background tiles.\n\nIn addition, you will be able to manage the tenants themselves.  As of now, you will be able to prevent crewmember graduation, (now you can do all the quests you want!) and prevent quest participation alltogether.  (now everyone wont have exclamation marks over their head).  These options are on a tenant-by-tenant basis, so feel free to customize each one as you see fit.\n\nYou will also be able to export these NPC tenants as NPC Cards (vanilla items that are modified to contain npc data). These cards are used for backup, management, and are designed to work with NpcSpawner+ 3100 series spawner objects!  So feel free to export a tenant, modify it using a NpcSpawner+ object, and re-import the changed tenant!\n\n[h1]How To Make:[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]Create a T3 Table\n[*]Create an Employer Station using said Inventor's Table\n[*]Purchase the Tenantator 2000 from the Employer's Station\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]How to Use:[/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]Find the deed you wish to modify\n[*]With the tenantator out, mouseover the deed and press the LMB\n[*]Modify the deed via the bottom menu, and/or by selecting a tenant or \"new tenant\" list option\n[/olist]\n\n\n[h1]Full Multiplayer Compatibility:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]All deed modifications\n[*]All tenant modifications\n[*]Multi-tenant support\n[*]Created NPC Cards\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Situational multiplayer compatbility:[/h1]\n\n[b]Both you and the server have this mod installed.[/b]\nYou are set.  Just be wary about other players that are around you (on the same planet/ship as you).  If they do not have this mod and you use the tool on a deed, they may disconnect.\n\n[b]The server has this mod, you do not.[/b]\nIf the server has this mod and you do not, then you may disconnect if you are on the same planet/ship as another player that tries to use the tenantator.  Any deeds that have been modified by this tool by other players will not affect your connectivity as the modifications done are in the base game.\n\n[b]You have this mod, the server does not.[/b]\nThe tool will act like any other custom active item that isnt installed on the server.  If not used or equipped you should be ok. Trying to use it will crash the tool and might kick you out of the server.  Any deed you modified on your ship (which will transfer to a multiplayer server) will continue to function with your modifications.\n\n[h1]Compatibility Cheetsheet[/h1]\nSo long as the actual lua functions specifically dealing with tenant management are untouched this mod will work as intended. That means mods that add/change config files and/or modify other deed capabilities like rent & house calculation should still be viable.\n\nto help ease compatibility checks heres a cheatsheet of known compatibilities from the comments section, will update frequently:\n\n\"Frackin' Universe\" - compatible\n\"Colony Tweaks\" - compatible\n\"Themed colony deeds\" - compatible\n\"Colony Deed Wiring\" - compatible\n\"pandora's monsters\" - specific monsters currently turn hostile when added (maybe you want that?). Working on a fix\n\nIf you are unsure of a compatibility, post it in the comments and I will reply (and update this list) asap.\n\nAs for functionality, the most damaging thing that could possibly happen is that the deed you tried to modify will need to be replaced.\n\n\n[h1]Security:[/h1]This tool's functionality is limited to Deeds that only beling to you!  You can turn off this functionality on a deed by deed basis from the deed's main menu.\n\n\n[h1]Uninstallation:[/h1]\nWhile a simple unsubscribe will do the trick, its best practice to delete the item before doing so. The employer's table that this item is bought from is an unused vanilla asset, and will not cause asset mismatching errors.\n\n[b]Technical details:[/b]\nThe mod comes with a custom activeitem \"npcinjector\" and stagehand \"colonymanager\".  On use, the activeitem creates the stagehand that acts on behalf of the deed you are modifiing.  This includes modifying tenant information and deed config parameters.  Once the player is too far away, or closes the pane menu, the stagehand is destroyed.  The stagehand is extremely lightweight, self-cleaning and non-persistant so nothing remains after modification is complete.  This allows for easy installation/uninstallation and will allow for MP sessions without breaking the deeds themselves or locking out players without this mod.\nHave fun!\n\n[h1]1.1.0 Update[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Added a toggleable option to open up tenantator modifications to other players (off by default).  This option is on a deed by deed basis, and only toggleable by the owner.\n[*]Note that the API does not allow me to determine player friends or party members. Therefore toggling owner-only access off will allow [b]anyone[/b] to modify it.  I advise turning owner-only security off only when necessary and/or when you trust all players that are able to visit the deed.\n[/list]",
